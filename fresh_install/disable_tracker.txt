1. Disabling tracker for globally (for all users)
Edit /etc/xdg/autostart/trackerd.desktop file with root priviledges (sudo vim, gksudo gedit ...)
Add "Hidden=true" to the end of the file
Do the same for /etc/xdg/autostart/tracker-applet.desktop if you want

2. Disabling tracker for your user only
Enter the directory "~/.config/autostart", create it if it does not exist
Create a file named trackerd.desktop
Paste the following into the file, save and exit

      [Desktop Entry]
      Encoding=UTF-8
      Name=Tracker
      Hidden=true

The file names/application names have been changed,

Here is the a method based on the same idea ( modified from
https://gist.github.com/vancluever/d34b41eb77e6d077887c )

```bash

tracker daemon -t
cd ~/.config/autostart
cp -v /etc/xdg/autostart/tracker-* ./
for FILE in `ls tracker-*`; do echo Hidden=true >> $FILE; done
rm -rf ~/.cache/tracker ~/.local/share/tracker

```
